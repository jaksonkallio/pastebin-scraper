	Our issue is that we would like to solve is web security and information leaking. A common issue with people is their own credentials being leaked and stored on a website. There is several of website that allow dumping of different random garbage that people can sift through to get information. There is a lot of random stuff that is just meaning less. The approached we decided to take is to make a scraper to scape a website to find important material. We currently have it able to ask for a URL and scrape a webpage. The website we use is called pastebin. To hooked to pastebin√ïs API it requires a 50-dollar purchase instead we just scrape pastebin raw data which makes it easier to format out the html. This project is ready to be hooked to the api we just did not want to fork over the money.  We would like to develop this into a tool that allows it to scrape virtually most major pastebin type sites, so it will look for your own personal information to find out if your information has been leaked. To get to this approach we decided to make the crawler in java. We first had to connect the code to the basic website by using java built in function called URL. This is a broad library that allows a java program to set a variable identity as a url. After that we read in the various text field using an IO reader class. The hardest part is when you read in the website data you have to store the data in a variable field that is easy to manipulate. We decided to create our own array list type that was able to manipulate it. We stored the data in an array list, from here we were able to search the paste results. The list is able to check line number so if the key word the user entered appeared in the file it then allowed that one line to be printed out. This is the way we are able to print out certain lines. The GUI was added in addition to create an easy and clean format to find data and see the results.
